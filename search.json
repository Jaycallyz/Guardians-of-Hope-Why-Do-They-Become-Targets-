    "text": "Approach Overview\nIn this data preprocessing workflow, we focus on cleaning and categorizing key fields to ensure consistency and facilitate analysis. The Verified field is standardized and converted into a binary flag (verified_flag), distinguishing between confirmed and unverified records. The Source field is categorized into “Official Source,” “Unofficial Source,” “Archived,” and “Unknown” to classify the credibility of the data.\nTo capture the impact on different organizations, we create the affected_organizations column, listing all entities that reported affected personnel in a given incident. Additionally, we classify each country into its respective continent based on predefined regional groupings. This allows for geographic analysis and trend identification.\nThe final cleaned dataset provides a structured foundation for further statistical analysis and visualization, ensuring accuracy and reliability in security incident reporting.\n\n\nData Cleaning\n\n# load library\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n# read csv\ndf &lt;- read.csv(\"../../data/security_incidents.csv\", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\n\n# Processing the Verified \ndf$Verified &lt;- tolower(df$Verified)  \ndf$verified_flag &lt;- case_when(\n  df$Verified == \"yes\" ~ 1,\n  df$Verified %in% c(\"archived\", \"pen\", \"pending\") ~ 0,\n  TRUE ~ NA_real_  \n)\n\n# Processing the Source\ndf$source_category &lt;- case_when(\n  df$Source %in% c(\"Official Report\", \"Focal Point\") ~ \"Official Source\",\n  df$Source %in% c(\"Media\", \"ACLED\") ~ \"Unofficial Source\",\n  df$Source == \"Archived\" ~ \"Archived\",\n  TRUE ~ \"Unknown\"\n)\n\n# Identify affected organizations (multiple organizations can be affected)\ndf &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    affected_organizations = apply(select(., UN, INGO, ICRC, NRCS.and.IFRC, NNGO, Other), 1, \n                                   function(x) paste(names(x)[x &gt;

    "text": "On the frontlines of humanitarian aid, workers worldwide face increasing security threats. Violence is frequent, putting their lives at constant risk. Attacks vary from aerial bombardments and shootings to kidnappings, sexual violence, and IED explosions. The motives behind these attacks range from political and economic disputes to incidental or other complex reasons.\nData analysis helps uncover patterns and trends in these threats. Through visualization, we can identify the most dangerous regions, the most common attack types, the risks faced by different organizations, and ways to enhance worker safety.\nThis report leverages data and visual analytics to explore the security challenges faced by humanitarian workers. Analyzing geographic distribution, trends over time, organizational differences, personnel risks, and attack motives, we present insights through static and interactive visualizations to make the data more accessible and actionable.\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(leaflet)\nlibrary(leaflet.extras)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\nCode\n# Read the data\ndf &lt;- read.csv(\"../data/clean_data.csv\", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\n\n# Filter out rows where latitude and longitude are missing\ndf_clean &lt;- df[!is.na(df$Latitude) & !is.na(df$Longitude),]\n\n# colorpalette\nheatmap_colors &lt;- colorRampPalette(c(\"#0000FF\",\"#00FF00\", \"#FFFF00\", \"#FF7F00\", \"#FF0000\"))(6)\n\n# Create the leaflet map\nleaflet(df_clean) %&gt;%\n  addTiles() %&gt;%\n  \n  # Add layer control to allow users to toggle between heatmap and markers\n  addLayersControl(\n    overlayGroups = c(\"Heatmap\", \"Incident Markers\"),\n    options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  \n  # Add heatmap and assign it to a group\n  addHeatmap(\n    lat = ~Latitude, lng = ~Longitude,\n    intensity = ~Total.affected,\n    blur = 20, max = 0.05,\n    group = \"Heatmap\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  \n  # Add incident markers and assign them to another group\n  addCircleMarkers(\n    ~Longitude, ~Latitude,\n    radius = 5,\n    color = \"blue\",\n    fillOpacity = 0.7,\n    group = \"Incident Markers\",\n    popup = ~paste(\n      \"&lt;strong&gt;\", Year, \" - \", Country, \"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\",\n      \"&lt;b&gt;Organization:&lt;/b&gt; \", affected_organizations, \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n      \"&lt;b&gt;Casualties:&lt;/b&gt; Killed \", Total.killed, \" | Wounded \", Total.wounded, \" | Kidnapped \", Total.kidnapped, \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n      \"&lt;b&gt;Attack Type:&lt;/b&gt; \", Means.of.attack, \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n      \"&lt;b&gt;Attack Context:&lt;/b&gt; \", Attack.context\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  \n  # add explanation legend\n  addLegend(\n    position = \"bottomright\",\n    colors = rev(heatmap_colors),  \n    labels = c(\"Very High\", \"High\", \"Moderately High\", \"Moderate\", \"Low\", \"Very Low\"),\n    title = \"Incident Density\",\n    opacity = 0.7\n  ) %&gt;%\n  \n  # Add a title centered at the top of the map\n  addControl(\"&lt;h3 style='text-align:center;'&gt;Global Security Incident Map&lt;/h3&gt;\", position = \"topright\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this plot, it shows that humanitarian workers face highly uneven security threats worldwide. The most dangerous hotspots are concentrated in East-Central Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia, particularly in Somalia, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Pakistan. These regions display “Very High” incident density (red areas), indicating that long-term regional conflicts, political instability, and extremist group activities pose persistent threats to humanitarian work. In contrast, East Asia, South America, and North America show significantly lower incident density, while Central America, Southeast Asia, and Eastern Europe present moderate risk levels.\n\n\n\n\nThis pie chart reveals the harsh reality of humanitarian work. The data shows that among all recorded security incidents, fatalities represent the largest proportion, accounting for over 40% of the total. This alarming percentage indicates that the risks in humanitarian work are not merely threats but direct dangers to life. This is followed by injury incidents at approximately 35%, while kidnapping incidents account for about 25%.\nThese three types of incidents constitute the main threats faced by humanitarian workers in dangerous regions. Notably, death and injury incidents together make up around 75% of the total, highlighting that violent actions against humanitarian workers are typically aimed at causing physical harm rather than just kidnapping for ransom. These statistics emphasize the urgency of strengthening security measures for humanitarian workers."

This reflects their broad presence and active operations in high-risk areas.\nNational NGOs and UN agencies also face substantial security threats, ranking second and third respectively. This highlights that both international and local organizations working on the front lines of conflict and crisis are vulnerable to danger.\nIn contrast, organizations within the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement show relatively lower numbers of affected individuals. This may be due to their neutral status, unique operational strategies, and access mechanisms.\nInterestingly, the composition of incident types varies across organizations. Only INGOs and the UN show a higher proportion of injuries, whereas other groups are more heavily affected by fatalities. This suggests the need for tailored security strategies based on the specific risk profiles of different organization types."
